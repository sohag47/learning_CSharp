## 1: C# Foundations
  ### 1.1 Input / Output processing & Variables.
    Console.Write("What is your name?"); // With newline
    string name = Console.ReadLine();
    Console.WriteLine(name);
  ### 1.2 Understand Predefined Types
  - [X] Value Types (int, float, char, etc.)
  - [X] Reference Types (string, object)
  
  ### 1.3 Type Conversions
    string input = "123";
    int number = Convert.ToInt32(input);
    double d = Convert.ToDouble("3.14");
    bool b = Convert.ToBoolean("true");
  ### 1.4 Nullable types
    int? number = null;
    int result = number ?? 0;
  ### 1.5 Control Flow Statements
  - [X] if-else
  - [X] switch
- [ ] Loops
  - [X] for
  - [X] foreach
  - [ ] while
  - [ ] do-while
 ### 1.6 Error Handling
  - [X] try-catch-finally
- [ ] Other Statements
