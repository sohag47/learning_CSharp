## âœ… Stage 1: C# Foundations
  ### 1.1 Input / Output processing & Variables.
    Console.Write("What is your name?"); // With newline
    string name = Console.ReadLine();
    Console.WriteLine(name);
  ### 1.2 Understand Predefined Types
  - [X] Value Types (int, float, char, etc.)
  - [X] Reference Types (string, object)
  
  ## 1.3 Type Conversions
    string input = "123";
    int number = Convert.ToInt32(input);
    double d = Convert.ToDouble("3.14");
    bool b = Convert.ToBoolean("true");
  ## 1.4 Nullable types
    int? number = null;
    int result = number ?? 0;
  ## 1.5 Control Flow Statements
  - [X] if-else
  - [X] switch
- [ ] Loops
  - [X] for
  - [X] foreach
  - [ ] while
  - [ ] do-while
 ## 1.6 Error Handling
  - [X] try-catch-finally
- [ ] Other Statements
  - [ ] using
  - [ ] lock
  - [ ] unsafe
  - [ ] yield
 ## 1.7 Operators
  - [X] Arithmetic
  - [X] Assignment
  - [X] Relational
  - [ ] Bitwise
  - [ ] Overflow/Underflow (checked/unchecked)

- [ ] Classes and Objects
  - [ ] Fields (static, instance, readonly)
  - [X] Field, properties & Auto properties: { get; set; }
  - [X] Access Modifiers (public, private, protected, internal, protected internal, private protected)
  - [ ] Storage & Behavior Modifiers (static, const, required, readonly, volatile, unsafe)
  - [X] Methods (static, instance, override, abstract, virtual)
  - [X] Method Overloading
  - [ ] Method Override
  - [ ] Constructors (static, instance)
  - [X] Constructor, Destructor/Finalizer
  - [X] Constructor chaining

- [ ] Enums
- [ ] Inheritance and Polymorphism
- [ ] Interfaces and Delegates
- [X] Namespaces
- [ ] Using Generics
  - [ ] Generic Class, Constraints and  Generic Method
  - [ ] Built in Generic data structures (List<T>, Dictionary<K,V>, Queue<T>, Stack<T>, HashSet<T>, SortedList<K,V>, SortedDictionary<K,V>)
  - [ ] Concurrent Collections (for multithreading) (ConcurrentDictionary<K,V>,ConcurrentQueue<T>, ConcurrentStack<T>, BlockingCollection<T>)
  - [ ] Non-generics collection

## ðŸ”¶ Stage 3: Collections and Data Structures

- [ ] Generic Collections (System.Collections.Generic)
  - [X] List<T>
  - [X] Dictionary<TKey, TValue>
  - [ ] Queue<T>
  - [ ] Stack<T>
  - [ ] HashSet<T>
  - [ ] LinkedList<T>
- [ ] Non-generic Collections
  - [ ] ArrayList
  - [ ] Hashtable
  - [ ] SortedList
  - [ ] Stack
  - [ ] Queue
- [X] Arrays
  - [X] Single-dimensional Arrays
  - [X] Multi-dimensional Arrays
